Wow, okay, just walked out of Henry Danger: The Movie and, honestly, my brain is like a scrambled egg trying to make sense of it all. The theater was so darn noisy—like, who even lets toddlers thump around during the climax? I could hardly hear the second explosion scene, the one where Jasper’s, uh, head got stuck in that oversized fish bowl. Such a mess. And why did Charlotte suddenly have those ridiculous platform sneakers? Made me rethink my own designs, you know? Popcorn crumbs are like everywhere on me right now, and darn, my back feels like it belongs to an 80-year-old. But, wow, what a rollercoaster.

> So there was this moment — I swear, like right after Henry’s suit malfunctioned in the museum — and I'm sure you remember, like Captain Man just did a backflip. I could feel everyone collectively hold their breath, even though someone behind me kept coughing like a chain-smoker. It felt like an alternate universe where fish wear bowties or something. God, I think I’m still dazed from that slow-motion jumping sequence. It's like the memory is glitching in my brain. Download the movie if you missed it, I guess? Although the bad CGI looked better on a small screen...

Grabbed the last Gummy Worm from the pack as Piper started yelling—her voice a broken fire alarm, oddly comforting yet maddening. I kinda love her though. And then, did anyone else compare Henry’s bike to a pair of polka dot loafers oddly? Maybe it was the vibrations, maybe I’m just crazy. Feels like the movie just juxtaposed my thoughts, you know? Like trying to design a shoe that walks by itself.

Keep thinking there’s something deep about Schwoz’s robot army, although their movements made me think they were dancing the cha-cha rather than conquering the world. But gosh, Piper’s scream? Glorious, like ten thousand vuvuzelas trapped in a metal box.

Man, if my shoes can shout that loud? I would have reached shoe-nivore status or some. Oh! And remember, watch the movie, it’s like… living in a candy store; each frame tasted differently in my brain. Or maybe I’m just hungry.

Uh, how’d Jasper even get those emails mixed up with Henry's last voicemail? Physics equations on a Tuesday. Just like this weird deja vu from last week’s shoe prototype failure. Henry’s grin was more dazzling than I imagined it’d be in 3D, though.
